# Breaking Changes

This project uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) via
the [semantic release](https://www.npmjs.com/package/semantic-release) node module.

Where possible we try and avoid breaking changes, however there will be some scenarios where this is unavoidable.

The [release notes](https://github.com/Legal-and-General/dependabot-batcher/releases) for the package will document any
breaking changes. You should always try and keep on the most up-to-date version of the package, this will reduce the
impact of having to handle multiple breaking changes in one go.
